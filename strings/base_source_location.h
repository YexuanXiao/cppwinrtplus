// The intrinsics (such as __builtin_FILE()) that power std::source_location are also used to power winrt:impl::slim_source_location.
// The source location needs to be for the calling code, not cppwinrt itself, so that it is useful to developers building on top of
// this library.  As a result any public-facing method that can result in an error needs a default-constructed slim_source_location
// argument so that it will collect source information from the application code that is calling into cppwinrt.
//
// We do not directly use std::source_location for two reasons:
//  1) std::source_location::function_name() is unavoidable.  These strings end up in the final binary, bloating their size.  This
//     is particularly impactful for code bases that use templates heavily.  Cases of 50% binary size growth have been observed.
//  2) std::source_location is a cpp20 feature, which is above the cpp17 feature floor for cppwinrt.  By defining our own version
//     we can avoid ODR violations in mixed cpp17/cpp20 builds.  cpp17 callers will have an ABI that matches cpp20 callers (they
//     will just not have useful file/line/function information).
//
// Some projects may decide that the source information binary size impact is not worth the benefit.  Defining WINRT_NO_SOURCE_LOCATION
// will prevent this feature from activating.  The slim_source_location type will be forwarded around but it will not include any
// nonzero data.  That eliminates the biggest source of binary size overhead.
//
// To help with debugging the __builtin_FUNCTION() intrinsic will be used in _DEBUG builds.  This will provide a bit more diagnostic
// value at the cost of binary size.  The assumption is that binary size is considered less important in debug builds so this tradeoff
// is acceptable.
//
// The different behavior of the default parameters to winrt::impl::slim_source_location::current() is technically an ODR violation,
// albeit a minor one.  There should be no serious consequence to this violation.  In practice it means that mixing cpp17/cpp20,
// or mixing WINRT_NO_SOURCE_LOCATION with undefining it, will lead to inconsistent source location information.  It may be missing
// when it is expected to be included, or it may be present when it is not expected.  The behavior will depend on the linker's choice
// when there are multiple translation units with different options.  This violation is tracked by https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt/issues/1445.
